# Proposal: Presidential Range — East Coast Backcountry Prototype

Submitted by: Tom Caron

Overview:
This prototype demonstrates ingestion-ready modeling for key Presidential Range ski routes (King Ravine, Castle Ravine, Jefferson Ravine, Great Gulf). Included are GeoJSON routes, per-route metadata, a minimal API, and a Mapbox preview.

Ask:
I’d like to discuss collaborating with onX to scale this dataset for production (licensed geometries, QA, PostGIS ingestion, slope-angle analysis for avalanche screening). I’m open to contractor, intern, or contributor roles.

Attachments:
- GitHub repo with prototype
- Mapbox preview demo

Next steps I propose if onX is interested:
1. Review prototype together (15–20 min demo)
2. Align on data schema & QA requirements
3. Replace placeholder geometries with field/ licensed GPX
4. Integrate into onX ingestion pipeline & pilot publish
